### System programming & Algorithm â€• Linux programming

* strace_0.c -  A program that executes and traces a given command. Each time a syscall is intercepted, it prints its number, followed by a new line

Usage: ./strace_0 command [args...]

```
$make strace_0
[...]
$./strace_0 /bin/echo Holberton
